# Pastejacking

**Pastejacking** is a cybersecurity threat that occurs when malicious actors manipulate the content that gets pasted into a user's clipboard. When a user copies content from a website, attackers can secretly replace the copied text with their own malicious commands or code. The user, unaware of the substitution, pastes the content into a terminal or another sensitive environment, potentially leading to severe consequences.

## How Pastejacking Works
1. **Manipulation of Clipboard Content**: Attackers use JavaScript or other scripting languages to alter the content in a user's clipboard when they copy text from a compromised web page.
2. **Execution of Malicious Commands**: The manipulated content can include harmful commands that, when pasted into a terminal or other command-line interfaces, execute with the userâ€™s privileges.
3. **Lack of User Awareness**: Since the clipboard content is often invisible, users do not notice the substitution until the pasted content is executed.

## Risks Involved
- **Unauthorized Command Execution**: The most significant risk of Pastejacking is the unintentional execution of unauthorized or malicious commands, which can lead to system compromise.
- **Data Theft**: Malicious commands can be used to extract sensitive information, including passwords, tokens, or other confidential data.
- **System Hijacking**: In severe cases, attackers can gain complete control over the system by executing commands that alter system configurations or download malware.

## Preventive Measures
- **Disable JavaScript on Untrusted Sites**: By disabling JavaScript on sites that are not trusted, users can prevent the execution of malicious scripts that might alter clipboard content.
- **Verify Pasted Content**: Always verify the content before pasting it into sensitive environments like terminals, especially when copying from untrusted or unknown sources.
- **Use Security Tools**: Employ security tools or browser extensions that monitor clipboard activity and alert users to potential pastejacking attempts.

Understanding and being aware of Pastejacking is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity, especially for individuals who frequently interact with command-line interfaces.
