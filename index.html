            <h2>1. What is Hacking?</h2>
            <p>Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks. It is the unauthorized access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. While hacking can refer to the act of compromising digital devices, it can also refer to the activity of finding and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and networks, often to gain unauthorized access to them.</p>

            <p>Historically, the term "hacking" has had different connotations. In the early days of computing, hacking simply meant creative problem-solving and exploring the capabilities of computer systems. However, over time, the term has become associated more with illegal and unethical activities. Today, hacking encompasses a wide range of actions, from benign tinkering and exploration to malicious attacks aimed at stealing data, damaging systems, or causing widespread disruption.</p>

            <p>The motivations behind hacking can vary widely. Some hackers do it for the thrill and challenge, while others are motivated by financial gain, political reasons, or social causes. There are also ethical hackers, often known as "white hat" hackers, who use their skills to help organizations improve their security by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>One of the most common forms of hacking is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in software or hardware. These vulnerabilities can be the result of coding errors, design flaws, or inadequate security measures. Hackers use various techniques to discover and exploit these weaknesses, such as scanning for open ports, using automated tools to test for common vulnerabilities, or conducting more sophisticated attacks like SQL injection or buffer overflow attacks.</p>

            <p>Social engineering is another prevalent method used by hackers. This involves manipulating people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Techniques such as phishing, pretexting, and baiting are common forms of social engineering. For example, in a phishing attack, a hacker might send an email that appears to be from a legitimate source, tricking the recipient into clicking a malicious link or providing sensitive information.</p>
