                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Every computer system has its vulnerabilities—hackers demonstrate this every day. But who can defend against them? Surprisingly, the answer is hackers themselves.</p>
    
                <p>“Ethical hacking” may sound paradoxical, but when carried out to identify and remedy system weaknesses, it's not only legal but essential.</p>
                
                <p>Want to become an ethical hacker and contribute to this digital immune system? This guide will explore what ethical hacking is, the necessary skills and education, the job market, and safe, legal ways to practice hacking. We'll also delve into ethical hacking competitions, where participants can win significant rewards—one 2022 event offered more than $1 million in prize money.</p>

                <h2>What Is an Ethical Hacker?</h2>
                <p>Hackers identify and exploit gaps and weaknesses in computer systems. Ethical hackers identify the same weaknesses, but do so with the intention of fixing them. The roles of malicious hacker and ethical hacker require similar skills, traits, and techniques, but their motivations are quite different.</p>

The roles of malicious hacker and ethical hacker require similar skills, traits, and techniques, but their motivations are quite different.</p>
                <p>Malicious hackers make unauthorized attempts to access computer systems or networks. In response, organizations authorize ethical hackers to identify and close those gaps. Basically, organizations pay ethical hackers to help protect their systems and data from malicious hackers.</p>
                <p>According to Purplesec, a cyber security company run by U.S. veterans, cybercrime increased globally by 600 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic and could cost $10.5 trillion by 2025. And, in addition to impacting sensitive data, malicious hackers can even cause harm through medical devices. For example, the late hacker Barnaby Jack demonstrated how to hack pacemakers and insulin pumps so that the loophole giving hackers access could be fixed. In this instance, ethical hacking showed a potential to save lives.</p>

                <h2>Types of Hackers</h2>
                <img src="pastejacking.png" alt="Pastejacking Example">
                <div class="hackers-types">
                    

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="bold">Black Hat:</span> These are cybercriminals. Black hat hackers attack vulnerabilities with malicious intent.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">White Hat:</span> Also known as security specialists, white hat hackers look for the same vulnerabilities as black hats but determine how to fix the issues and prevent future attacks. Sometimes, black hats become white hats.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Gray Hat:</span> Gray hats have mixed motivations. They enjoy hacking and often do so without authorization, but they don’t act maliciously. Grey hats often view hacking as sport.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Blue Hat:</span> Tech companies hire blue hat hackers to test products and find security issues. Microsoft hosts an annual BlueHat convention.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Red Hat:</span> Also known as vigilante hackers, red hats act aggressively to stop the black hats and employ some of their strategies. Government agencies hire red hats for their mission focus.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Green Hat:</span> These are the hacking beginners who want to become white, blue, or red hats (but hopefully not black hats). How do they learn? Let’s take a look.</li>

                <h2>How to Become an Ethical Hacker</h2>
                <p>Those with a curious mind, a taste for coding, and a tenacious personality may want to consider ethical hacking. It requires discipline and a sense of ethics—as the name suggests.</p>
    
                <p>From a tech perspective, ethical hackers must understand networks and operating systems, notably Windows and Linux. <span class="bold">JavaScript, Python, and SQL</span> are among the leading languages ethical hackers use, but additional languages may be needed depending on the types of systems being accessed and their security posture.</p>
                
                <p>There are several ways to learn ethical hacking. Information security analysts typically hold degrees in computer science or information technology, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), but that's not the only educational pathway. For instance, 8 percent of penetration testers—an emerging role in cyber security—have a high school diploma or equivalent, according to CareerOneStop. In addition, many have learned through independent study, online courses, or boot camps. Here are some resources to help you get started in ethical hacking:</p>
